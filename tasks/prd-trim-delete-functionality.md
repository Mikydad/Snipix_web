# Product Requirements Document: Trim and Delete Functionality

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds professional video editing capabilities to the timeline interface, allowing users to trim and delete segments from video layers. The functionality provides real-time visual feedback and maintains the integrity of the main video layer while supporting precise editing operations.

## Goals

1. Enable users to trim video segments by selecting ranges on the timeline
2. Allow deletion of trimmed segments with automatic gap filling for main video layer
3. Provide real-time visual feedback during trim operations
4. Maintain timeline synchronization with video preview
5. Support undo/redo operations for trim/delete actions
6. Ensure instant frontend updates with backend processing on completion

## User Stories

1. **As a video editor**, I want to click on a layer in the timeline so that I can select it for editing operations.

2. **As a video editor**, I want to see trim/delete buttons appear when I select a layer so that I can access editing tools.

3. **As a video editor**, I want to click and drag on the timeline to select a range so that I can specify what to trim.

4. **As a video editor**, I want to use handles on layer edges to adjust trim points so that I can make precise edits.

5. **As a video editor**, I want to see a preview of the trimmed segment in the video preview so that I can verify my selection before applying.

6. **As a video editor**, I want to delete trimmed segments so that I can remove unwanted content.

7. **As a video editor**, I want gaps to automatically fill for the main video layer so that the timeline remains continuous.

8. **As a video editor**, I want the timeline duration to update instantly when I trim/delete segments so that I can see the new length immediately.

9. **As a video editor**, I want to prevent accidental deletion of the entire main video so that I don't lose my content.

10. **As a video editor**, I want to click "Done" to apply all changes so that the backend processes the final video.

## Functional Requirements

### Layer Selection
1. The system must allow users to click on any layer in the timeline to select it
2. The system must highlight the selected layer visually
3. The system must show trim/delete buttons only when a layer is selected
4. The system must allow selection of only one layer at a time

### Trim Functionality
5. The system must allow users to click and drag on the timeline to select a trim range
6. The system must provide handles on layer edges for precise trim point adjustment
7. The system must show the selected trim range highlighted on the timeline
8. The system must display the trimmed segment preview in the video preview
9. The system must allow trimming of any segment within the layer duration
10. The system must prevent trimming beyond the layer boundaries

### Delete Functionality
11. The system must allow users to delete selected trimmed segments
12. The system must automatically fill gaps for the main video layer only
13. The system must keep other layers in their original positions when trimmed
14. The system must prevent deletion of the entire main video layer
15. The system must show an error message when attempting to delete the entire main video

### Timeline Updates
16. The system must update the timeline duration instantly when segments are trimmed/deleted
17. The system must maintain timeline synchronization with video preview
18. The system must update all duration counters in real-time
19. The system must adjust the timeline ruler to reflect new durations

### Main Video Layer Rules
20. The system must treat the main video layer (the original uploaded video) with special rules
21. The system must automatically fill gaps in the main video layer when segments are deleted
22. The system must adjust the timeline start point to 0:00 when the beginning is trimmed
23. The system must maintain continuous segments within the main video layer

### Backend Processing
24. The system must process all trim/delete operations on the frontend first
25. The system must only send backend requests when the user clicks "Done"
26. The system must use FFmpeg for final video processing
27. The system must show a loading state during backend processing

### User Interface
28. The system must display trim/delete buttons in the timeline toolbar
29. The system must show visual feedback for selected ranges
30. The system must provide clear error messages for invalid operations
31. The system must include a "Done" button to apply all changes

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-layer editing**: Users cannot trim/delete segments from multiple layers simultaneously
2. **Advanced undo/redo**: Comprehensive undo/redo system for the entire timeline (to be implemented later)
3. **Real-time backend processing**: Backend processing happens only when "Done" is clicked
4. **Audio layer support**: This feature focuses only on video layers
5. **Export functionality**: Video export is not part of this feature
6. **Layer effects**: No visual effects or transitions are included

## Design Considerations

### UI Components
- **Timeline Toolbar**: Add trim/delete buttons that appear when layer is selected
- **Range Selection**: Visual highlighting of selected trim ranges
- **Layer Handles**: Draggable handles on layer edges for precise adjustment
- **Video Preview**: Show trimmed segment preview during selection
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for invalid operations

### Visual Feedback
- **Selected Layer**: Highlight with different color/border
- **Trim Range**: Show highlighted area on timeline
- **Handles**: Visual indicators on layer edges
- **Loading State**: Show progress during backend processing

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Implementation
- **State Management**: Extend Redux timeline slice to handle trim/delete operations
- **Timeline Component**: Add range selection and handle dragging functionality
- **Video Preview**: Integrate with trim preview display
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensure instant UI updates without backend calls

### Backend Integration
- **FFmpeg Processing**: Use existing media service for video trimming
- **Batch Operations**: Process all trim/delete operations in a single request
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide feedback during video processing

### Data Structure
- **Layer Segments**: Support internal segments within layers
- **Timeline State**: Track trim operations and pending changes
- **Video Metadata**: Update duration and segment information

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Increase in timeline editing operations by 40%
2. **Task Completion**: 90% of users successfully complete trim/delete operations
3. **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of operations result in errors
4. **Performance**: Frontend updates complete within 100ms
5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on editing precision and speed

## Open Questions

1. **Undo/Redo Implementation**: What level of undo/redo should be supported initially?
2. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle failed backend processing?
3. **Performance Optimization**: What's the maximum number of segments a layer should support?
4. **Accessibility**: How should keyboard navigation work for trim operations?
5. **Mobile Support**: Should this feature work on touch devices?
