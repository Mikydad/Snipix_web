# Product Requirements Document: Undo/Redo Functionality

## Introduction/Overview

The undo/redo functionality will provide users with the ability to reverse and reapply their actions within the timeline editor, preventing accidental mistakes and enabling creative experimentation. This feature addresses the common need for users to explore different editing approaches without fear of losing their work, while also providing a safety net for accidental operations.

## Goals

1. **Prevent User Mistakes**: Allow users to easily reverse accidental deletions, trims, or other operations
2. **Enable Creative Experimentation**: Let users try different editing approaches without permanent consequences
3. **Improve User Confidence**: Reduce anxiety about making changes by providing a safety net
4. **Enhance Workflow Efficiency**: Allow quick reversal of unwanted changes without starting over
5. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure undo/redo operations don't corrupt project state

## User Stories

1. **As a video editor**, I want to undo accidental deletions so that I don't lose my work
2. **As a creative user**, I want to experiment with different trim points and easily revert if I don't like the result
3. **As a timeline editor**, I want to undo layer position changes so that I can quickly fix misclicks
4. **As a user**, I want to see my recent actions so that I know what I can undo
5. **As a keyboard user**, I want to use Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y shortcuts so that I can work efficiently
6. **As a project manager**, I want undo/redo to be project-specific so that different projects don't interfere with each other

## Functional Requirements

### Core Undo/Redo Operations
1. The system must allow users to undo the last 20 actions performed in the timeline
2. The system must allow users to redo previously undone actions
3. The system must maintain a circular buffer of 20 actions to prevent memory issues
4. The system must clear undo/redo history when the project is saved

### Supported Operations
5. The system must support undoing trim operations (layer splitting)
6. The system must support undoing delete operations (segment removal)
7. The system must support undoing layer position changes (drag and drop)
8. The system must support undoing layer additions and removals
9. The system must support undoing video playback controls (play/pause, seeking) if technically feasible
10. The system must NOT allow undoing main video upload (core project file)
11. The system must allow undoing secondary layer video uploads

### User Interface
12. The system must provide undo/redo buttons in the timeline toolbar (next to trim/delete buttons)
13. The system must provide undo/redo buttons in the main header (next to play/back buttons)
14. The system must display a visual history panel showing recent actions near the play/back buttons
15. The system must show keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y for redo) in tooltips
16. The system must disable undo button when no actions are available to undo
17. The system must disable redo button when no actions are available to redo

### Visual Feedback
18. The system must indicate "dirty" state (unsaved changes) when undo/redo operations are performed
19. The system must show action descriptions in the history panel (e.g., "Deleted segment 0-5s", "Trimmed at 3.2s")
20. The system must highlight the current state in the history panel

### Data Management
21. The system must maintain undo/redo history per project (project-specific)
22. The system must persist undo/redo history across browser sessions for the current project
23. The system must clear history when switching between projects
24. The system must handle memory efficiently by limiting history to 20 actions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Collaborative Editing**: Undo/redo for multiple users working on the same project
2. **UI State Changes**: Undo/redo for zoom level, panel visibility, or other UI-only changes
3. **Cross-Project History**: Sharing undo/redo history between different projects
4. **Infinite History**: Unlimited undo/redo operations (limited to 20 for performance)
5. **Backend Video Processing Undo**: Reversing actual video file modifications (only timeline state)

## Design Considerations

### Timeline Toolbar Integration
- Undo/redo buttons should be placed next to existing trim/delete buttons
- Use standard undo/redo icons (↶ for undo, ↷ for redo)
- Buttons should be disabled when no actions are available
- Consistent styling with existing toolbar buttons

### Header Integration
- Additional undo/redo buttons in main header for easy access
- Visual history panel showing last 5-10 actions with descriptions
- Compact design that doesn't interfere with existing header elements

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac) for undo
- Ctrl+Y (Cmd+Y on Mac) for redo
- Tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts
- Prevent browser default undo behavior when in timeline editor

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Extend existing Redux timeline slice with undo/redo state
- Implement action history as a circular buffer
- Store action metadata (type, description, timestamp)
- Integrate with existing validation state for dirty flag

### Performance
- Limit history to 20 actions to prevent memory issues
- Use efficient data structures for action storage
- Debounce rapid actions to prevent history bloat
- Clear history on project save to free memory

### Integration Points
- Hook into existing timeline operations (trim, delete, move)
- Integrate with video playback controls
- Connect with project save/load functionality
- Maintain compatibility with existing error handling

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: 80% of users utilize undo/redo functionality within first week
2. **Error Recovery**: 90% reduction in "accidental deletion" support requests
3. **Workflow Efficiency**: 25% increase in experimental editing behaviors
4. **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ rating for undo/redo functionality in user feedback
5. **Performance Impact**: No measurable slowdown in timeline operations

## Open Questions

1. **Action Granularity**: Should rapid consecutive actions (like multiple trims) be grouped into single undo steps?
2. **History Persistence**: Should undo/redo history be saved to the project file or kept in browser storage?
3. **Visual Feedback**: Should there be animations when undoing/redoing to show the transition?
4. **Error Handling**: How should the system handle undo/redo operations that fail due to data corruption?
5. **Mobile Support**: Should undo/redo work on touch devices with gesture-based interactions?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Core Functionality)
- Basic undo/redo infrastructure
- Timeline toolbar buttons
- Support for trim, delete, and position changes
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 2 (Enhanced UI)
- Header undo/redo buttons
- Visual history panel
- Action descriptions and metadata
- Dirty state indication

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
- Video playback control undo/redo
- Action grouping and optimization
- Enhanced visual feedback
- Performance optimizations
