# Product Requirements Document: MongoDB Atlas Database Integration

## Introduction/Overview

The MongoDB Atlas database integration will replace the current in-memory storage system with a persistent cloud database, ensuring that project data, timelines, and user progress are never lost when the backend restarts. This addresses the critical issue where all project data disappears after server restarts, requiring users to re-upload videos and recreate their work.

## Goals

1. **Persistent Data Storage**: Ensure project data survives backend restarts and server downtime
2. **Zero Data Loss**: Eliminate the need for users to re-upload videos after backend restarts
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Prepare the system for future growth and multiple users
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching layer for improved response times
5. **Reliability**: Add retry logic and error handling for database operations

## User Stories

1. **As a video editor**, I want my projects to persist after the backend restarts so that I don't lose my work
2. **As a user**, I want to reload the page without losing my timeline edits so that I can continue working seamlessly
3. **As a developer**, I want reliable data storage so that I can deploy the application without data loss concerns
4. **As a user**, I want fast loading times for my projects so that I can work efficiently
5. **As a system administrator**, I want automatic retry logic for database operations so that temporary network issues don't break the application

## Functional Requirements

### Database Integration
1. The system must connect to MongoDB Atlas using the provided connection string
2. The system must store project data (metadata, timeline state, video information) in MongoDB
3. The system must keep video files stored locally on the server (not in database)
4. The system must add timestamps, user ownership, and versioning fields to all documents
5. The system must implement proper database connection pooling for performance

### Data Migration
6. The system must start fresh with MongoDB (no migration of existing in-memory data)
7. The system must provide clear messaging to users about the fresh start
8. The system must maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

### Performance & Caching
9. The system must implement Redis caching layer for frequently accessed project data
10. The system must cache project metadata and timeline state for 5 minutes
11. The system must invalidate cache when project data is modified
12. The system must fall back to database queries when cache is unavailable

### Error Handling & Reliability
13. The system must implement retry logic for failed database operations (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
14. The system must provide user-friendly error messages for database connectivity issues
15. The system must log all database operations for debugging and monitoring
16. The system must handle MongoDB connection drops gracefully with automatic reconnection

### Data Structure Optimization
17. The system must optimize data structure for MongoDB (embedding related documents where appropriate)
18. The system must add indexes on frequently queried fields (projectId, userId, createdAt)
19. The system must implement data validation using MongoDB schema validation
20. The system must add soft delete functionality for projects (mark as deleted, not actually delete)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Video File Storage**: Storing actual video files in MongoDB (keep local storage)
2. **User Authentication**: Adding user management system (keep current anonymous system)
3. **Data Migration Tool**: Migrating existing in-memory data to MongoDB
4. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Supporting multiple organizations or user groups
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing the same project simultaneously

## Design Considerations

### MongoDB Atlas Configuration
- Use free tier (512MB) for development and testing
- Configure connection string with proper authentication
- Set up database indexes for optimal query performance
- Implement connection pooling with appropriate limits

### Data Structure Design
- Embed timeline data within project documents for better performance
- Use separate collections for different data types (projects, timelines, metadata)
- Add versioning fields for future data migration capabilities
- Implement soft delete pattern for data recovery

### Caching Strategy
- Cache project metadata and timeline state in Redis
- Use cache-aside pattern for read operations
- Implement cache invalidation on write operations
- Set appropriate TTL values for different data types

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Projects Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  projectId: String (unique),
  name: String,
  description: String,
  videoPath: String,
  duration: Number,
  timelineState: Object (embedded),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  createdBy: String,
  isDeleted: Boolean,
  version: Number
}

// Timeline States Collection (if needed separately)
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  projectId: String,
  layers: Array,
  playheadTime: Number,
  duration: Number,
  markers: Array,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Connection Management
- Use Motor (async MongoDB driver) for FastAPI integration
- Implement connection pooling with 10-20 connections
- Add connection health checks and automatic reconnection
- Use environment variables for connection string and credentials

### Error Handling
- Implement custom exception classes for database errors
- Add retry decorator for database operations
- Log all database operations with appropriate log levels
- Provide fallback responses for critical operations

## Success Metrics

1. **Data Persistence**: 100% of project data survives backend restarts
2. **Performance**: 90% reduction in project loading time through caching
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for database operations
4. **Error Recovery**: 95% of failed operations succeed after retry
5. **User Satisfaction**: Zero complaints about data loss after implementation

## Open Questions

1. **Connection String Security**: How should we securely store and manage the MongoDB connection string?
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Should we implement more sophisticated cache invalidation strategies?
3. **Data Backup**: Should we implement automated backup strategies for the MongoDB data?
4. **Monitoring**: What level of database monitoring and alerting should we implement?
5. **Scaling**: At what point should we consider upgrading from the free tier?
