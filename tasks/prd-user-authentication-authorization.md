# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication & Authorization

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of a comprehensive user authentication and authorization system for the Snipix video editing application. The system will enable users to create accounts, securely access their projects, and provide administrators with tools to manage users and monitor application usage. This feature addresses the current limitation where all projects are tied to a hardcoded user ID, preventing proper user isolation and data security.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, the application uses a hardcoded user ID (`"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"`) for all operations, meaning all projects belong to the same "user" with no real user separation, security, or personalization.

**Goal:** Implement a secure, scalable authentication system that enables users to access only their own projects while providing administrators with comprehensive user management capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Secure User Authentication**: Enable users to sign up and sign in using Google OAuth and email/password with email verification
2. **Project Isolation**: Ensure users can only access and modify their own projects
3. **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with "Remember Me" functionality and configurable timeouts
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Provide administrators with user management, analytics, and control capabilities
5. **Data Migration**: Seamlessly migrate existing projects to the first registered user
6. **User Experience**: Create an intuitive authentication flow that doesn't disrupt the existing editing experience

## User Stories

### End Users
- **As a new user**, I want to sign up using my Google account or email so that I can start creating video projects
- **As a user**, I want to sign in quickly and securely so that I can access my projects
- **As a user**, I want to use "Remember Me" so that I don't have to sign in every time
- **As a user**, I want to manage my profile and account settings so that I can customize my experience
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account
- **As a user**, I want to delete my account and export my data so that I have control over my information

### Administrators
- **As an admin**, I want to see how many users are registered so that I can track growth
- **As an admin**, I want to see how many projects each user has created so that I can understand usage patterns
- **As an admin**, I want to enable/disable user accounts so that I can manage access
- **As an admin**, I want to see user activity metrics (hours used, last login) so that I can monitor engagement
- **As an admin**, I want to view user analytics and system health so that I can make informed decisions

## Functional Requirements

9. **The system must provide configurable session timeout** settings for administrators
10. **The system must handle session refresh** automatically for active users
11. **The system must invalidate sessions** on logout and password changes

### Authorization & Access Control
12. **The system must ensure users can only access their own projects** through proper authorization checks
13. **The system must implement role-based access control** with User and Admin roles
14. **The system must protect all API endpoints** with proper authentication middleware
15. **The system must validate user permissions** before allowing project operations
16. **The system must prevent unauthorized access** to other users' data

### User Account Management
17. **The system must allow users to view and edit their profile information** (name, email, avatar)
18. **The system must allow users to change their password** with current password verification
19. **The system must allow users to delete their account** with data export option
20. **The system must allow users to export their data** in a standard format (JSON)
21. **The system must handle account deactivation** gracefully

### Admin Dashboard
22. **The system must provide an admin dashboard** accessible only to admin users
23. **The system must display total user count** and registration trends
24. **The system must show projects per user** with creation dates and activity
25. **The system must allow admins to enable/disable user accounts**
26. **The system must track and display user activity metrics** (login frequency, session duration, last activity)
27. **The system must provide user search and filtering** capabilities
28. **The system must show system health metrics** (active users, storage usage, API performance)

### Data Migration
29. **The system must migrate all existing projects** to the first registered user account
30. **The system must preserve all project data** during migration (videos, timelines, transcriptions)
31. **The system must handle migration errors gracefully** with rollback capability
32. **The system must provide migration status feedback** to administrators

### UI/UX Requirements
33. **The system must redirect unauthenticated users** to login/signup before accessing editing features
34. **The system must provide clear error messages** for authentication failures
35. **The system must show loading states** during authentication processes
36. **The system must maintain user context** across page refreshes and browser sessions
37. **The system must provide progressive error handling** with helpful suggestions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Social Login Integration**: Only Google OAuth will be supported initially (no Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: 2FA will not be implemented in the initial version
- **Advanced User Roles**: Only User and Admin roles will be supported initially
- **Team/Organization Management**: No team collaboration features in this phase
- **SSO Integration**: No enterprise SSO solutions (SAML, LDAP) in initial version
- **Advanced Analytics**: Basic metrics only, no detailed user behavior tracking
- **Mobile App Authentication**: Focus on web application only

## Design Considerations

### Frontend Components
- **Login/Signup Pages**: Clean, modern design with Google OAuth and email forms
- **Protected Routes**: Redirect logic for unauthenticated users
- **User Profile Page**: Settings, account management, data export
- **Admin Dashboard**: Data tables, charts, user management interface
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications and inline error messages

### UI Flow
1. **Unauthenticated users** → Redirected to login/signup page
2. **Successful authentication** → Redirected to projects page
3. **Admin users** → Access to admin dashboard via navigation
4. **Session expiration** → Graceful logout with re-authentication prompt

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Architecture
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation, validation, and refresh
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Email Service**: Integration with email provider for verification and password reset
- **Google OAuth**: Proper OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
- **Database Schema**: User collection with proper indexing and relationships
- **API Security**: Middleware for authentication and authorization on all protected routes

### Database Changes
- **User Collection**: New collection for user accounts with proper schema
- **Project Ownership**: Update project schema to reference user IDs
- **Session Storage**: JWT-based sessions with optional Redis for blacklisting
- **Audit Logging**: Track authentication events and user actions

### Security Measures
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Proper output encoding and CSP headers

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **User Registration Rate**: Target 80% of visitors who start signup complete registration
- **Session Duration**: Average session length increases by 25%
- **Return User Rate**: 70% of users return within 7 days of first login

### System Performance
- **Authentication Response Time**: < 200ms for login/signup operations
- **API Response Time**: No degradation in existing API performance
- **Error Rate**: < 1% authentication failure rate

### Security
- **Zero Security Incidents**: No unauthorized access to user data
- **Password Security**: 100% of passwords meet strength requirements
- **Session Security**: Proper session invalidation on logout

### Admin Efficiency
- **Admin Dashboard Usage**: Admins can complete user management tasks in < 2 minutes
- **User Support Reduction**: 50% reduction in authentication-related support tickets

## Open Questions
