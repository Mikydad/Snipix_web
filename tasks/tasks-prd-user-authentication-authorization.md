### Notes

- The codebase already has basic authentication infrastructure in place (auth_service.py, auth.py, authSlice.ts)
- All API endpoints currently use hardcoded user ID - need to replace with proper JWT authentication
- Frontend already has Navigation component with auth state - needs enhancement for new auth features
- Unit tests should be created for all new authentication components and services
