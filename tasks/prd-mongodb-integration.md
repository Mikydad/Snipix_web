# Product Requirements Document: MongoDB Integration for Snipix Video Editor

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of MongoDB Atlas as the primary database for the Snipix video editing application. The goal is to replace the current simple API with a robust, persistent database solution that supports all existing features including timeline editing, transcription processing, and project management, while maintaining local video file storage.

The integration will enable users to save their work progress, resume editing sessions, and maintain data consistency across all application features.

## Goals

1. **Persistent Data Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with MongoDB Atlas for reliable data persistence
2. **Feature Compatibility**: Ensure all current features (timeline editing, transcription, project management) work seamlessly with MongoDB
3. **Data Integrity**: Maintain data consistency and prevent loss of user work
4. **Performance Optimization**: Achieve comparable or better performance than the current simple API
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
6. **Seamless Migration**: Enable smooth transition from simple API to MongoDB without disrupting user experience

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Video Editors and Content Creators

1. **As a video editor**, I want my timeline progress to be automatically saved so that I can resume editing where I left off
2. **As a content creator**, I want my transcription data to be permanently stored so that I can reference it later
3. **As a user**, I want my project metadata to persist across browser sessions so that I don't lose my work
4. **As a video editor**, I want to be able to undo/redo my timeline changes so that I can experiment freely
5. **As a user**, I want the application to work reliably even if there are temporary database issues
6. **As a content creator**, I want to be able to manage multiple projects with all their associated data

## Functional Requirements

### Core Database Operations
1. The system must provide CRUD operations for projects (create, read, update, delete)
2. The system must store and retrieve project metadata (name, description, duration, timestamps)
3. The system must support project versioning and history tracking
4. The system must implement soft delete functionality for data recovery

### Timeline Management
5. The system must persist timeline states including trim points, segments, and layer configurations
6. The system must support timeline state versioning for undo/redo functionality
7. The system must automatically save timeline changes at regular intervals
8. The system must restore timeline state when a project is reopened

### Transcription Management
9. The system must store complete transcription data including text, timestamps, and speaker labels
10. The system must support transcription editing and updates
11. The system must maintain transcription-to-timeline synchronization
12. The system must handle large transcription datasets efficiently

### Data Persistence
13. The system must maintain user session data and progress tracking
14. The system must support concurrent user access to projects
15. The system must implement data validation and integrity checks
16. The system must provide data backup and recovery mechanisms

### Error Handling and Resilience
17. The system must implement automatic retry logic for database operations
18. The system must provide graceful degradation when database is unavailable
19. The system must log all database operations for debugging and monitoring
20. The system must implement connection pooling for optimal performance

### Migration and Compatibility
21. The system must support migration of existing projects from simple API to MongoDB
22. The system must maintain backward compatibility with existing project formats
23. The system must provide data migration tools and validation
24. The system must support rollback to simple API if needed

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Video File Storage**: Video files will continue to be stored locally, not in MongoDB
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing is not included in this phase
3. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior analytics and reporting features
4. **Data Export/Import**: Bulk data export/import functionality
5. **Advanced Security**: Enterprise-level security features beyond basic authentication
6. **Performance Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time performance monitoring UI

## Design Considerations

### Database Schema Design
- **Projects Collection**: Store project metadata and references
- **Timeline States Collection**: Store timeline configurations and history
- **Transcriptions Collection**: Store transcription data with proper indexing
- **User Sessions Collection**: Track user progress and preferences

### API Design
- Maintain existing API endpoints for seamless frontend integration
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Use consistent JSON response formats
- Support pagination for large datasets

### Data Models
- Use Pydantic models for data validation
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Support data versioning and migration

## Technical Considerations

### Database Technology
- **Primary**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
- **Driver**: Motor (async MongoDB driver for Python)
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with retry logic
- **Indexing**: Optimized indexes for common queries

### Integration Points
- **Existing Services**: Timeline service, transcription service, project service
- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints with proper error handling
- **Caching**: Redis integration for performance optimization
- **Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring and debugging

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for project retrieval
- **Throughput**: Support 100+ concurrent users
- **Data Size**: Handle projects with large transcription datasets
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: User-based access control
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Connection Security**: SSL/TLS encrypted connections
- **Access Control**: Project-level permissions

## Success Metrics

1. **Response Time**: Average API response time < 200ms
2. **Throughput**: Support 100+ concurrent users without degradation
3. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
4. **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate for database operations

### User Experience Metrics

2. **Migration Success**: 100% of existing projects successfully migrated
3. **Feature Compatibility**: All existing features work without modification
4. **User Satisfaction**: No increase in support tickets related to data loss

### Technical Metrics
