# Tasks: MongoDB Atlas Database Integration

## Relevant Files

- `backend/services/database.py` - Contains existing MongoDB connection setup and needs enhancement for Atlas integration
- `backend/services/database.py` - Unit tests for database service
- `backend/services/cache_service.py` - New Redis caching service for performance optimization
- `backend/services/cache_service.py` - Unit tests for cache service
- `backend/services/project_service.py` - New service layer for project CRUD operations with MongoDB
- `backend/services/project_service.py` - Unit tests for project service
- `backend/api/projects.py` - API endpoints that need to be updated to use MongoDB instead of in-memory storage
- `backend/api/projects.py` - Unit tests for projects API
- `backend/api/timeline.py` - Timeline API endpoints that need MongoDB integration
- `backend/api/timeline.py` - Unit tests for timeline API
- `backend/models/schemas.py` - Data models that need enhancement for MongoDB optimization
- `backend/models/schemas.py` - Unit tests for schema validation
- `backend/main.py` - Application startup that needs Redis initialization
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Dependencies file that needs Redis client addition
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variables template for MongoDB Atlas and Redis configuration
- `backend/config/settings.py` - New configuration management for database and cache settings
- `backend/config/settings.py` - Unit tests for configuration
- `backend/utils/retry_decorator.py` - New utility for retry logic with exponential backoff
- `backend/utils/retry_decorator.py` - Unit tests for retry decorator
- `backend/utils/error_handlers.py` - New error handling utilities for database operations
- `backend/utils/error_handlers.py` - Unit tests for error handlers

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `project_service.py` and `project_service.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `pytest` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- MongoDB Atlas connection string should be stored securely in environment variables.
- Redis caching is optional but recommended for performance optimization.
